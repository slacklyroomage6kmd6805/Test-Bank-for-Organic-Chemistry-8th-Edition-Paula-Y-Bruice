### Product Details:


* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0134074580
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0134074580
  * * Author: Paula Y. Bruice
   
  * Paula Bruice’s presentation in Organic Chemistry, Eighth Edition provides mixed-science majors with the conceptual foundations, chemical logic, and problem-solving skills they need to reason their way to solutions for diverse problems in synthetic organic chemistry, biochemistry, and medicine. The Eighth Edition builds a strong framework for thinking about organic chemistry by unifying principles of reactivity that students will apply throughout the course, discouraging memorization. With more applications than any other textbook, Dr. Bruice consistently relates structure and reactivity to what occurs in our own cells and reinforces the fundamental reason for all chemical reactions–electrophiles react with nucleophiles. New streamlined coverage of substitution and elimination, updated problem-solving strategies, synthesis skill-building applications and tutorials guide students throughout fundamental and complex content in both the first and second semesters of the course.
